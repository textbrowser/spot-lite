Spot-On-Lite supports Qt 4.8.7 and Qt 5.x. It has been tested on
Debian and OpenBSD. It compiles on Debian, Mac OS X, and OpenBSD.

Also included is a thread-safe Lisp implementation of SHA-512. Super fast, super cute.

On Linux, limiting the number of processes may be achieved
via /etc/security/limits.conf.
