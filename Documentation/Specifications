General Requirements

- Child processes should not create local files beyond SSL/TLS certificates
  and log files.
- Child processes should self-terminate after a configurable period of silence.
- Child processes will be terminated upon the parent receiving
  the SIGUSR1 signal.
- Congestion control entries are identified via SHA-1 (Qt 4.x),
  SHA-384 (Qt 5.0.x), or SHA3-384 (Qt 5.1.x or newer).
- Cryptographic Discovery requires SHA-512. Two separate implementations
  of SHA-512 are provided: one for Qt 4.x and another if
  SPOTON_LITE_DAEMON_CHILD_ECL_SUPPORTED is enabled (/usr/bin/ecl exists).
  For Qt 5.x, the SHA-512 implementation provided by Qt is applied unless
  SPOTON_LITE_DAEMON_CHILD_ECL_SUPPORTED is enabled.
- DTLS is supported for Qt 5.12.x or newer.
- Multiple instances of a daemon are allowed.
- Optional SSL/TLS within child processes.
- Terminating the daemon should terminate child processes.
- The configuration file is to be written in an INI format.
- The daemon must be very simple. That is, all essential activity must be
  performed by a child process. The daemon should only create child processes
  and echo data.
- The daemon must not require special permissions.
- The daemon must support the re-processing of its configuration
  file via SIGUSR1. Asynchronous-safe functions only.
- The daemon must support multiple listeners.
- The daemon will separate itself from its parent terminal. Separation is
  optional.
